# What to Know
Not inclusive, just a "must know" list.  For each topic, understand how to implement and use them.  And where applicable, the space and time complexity.

Practice implementing the data structures and algorithms.  Might be asked to implement them in your interview or a modification of them.  Either way, the more comfortable you are with them, the better.

## Advice for Technical Questions
A technical interview question can be solved utilizing a five step approach:

1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.
2. Design an Algorithm
3. Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you’re writing pseudo-code! Otherwise, he/she may think that you’re never planning to write “real” code, and many interviewers will hold that against you.
4. Write your code, not too slow and not too fast.
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes.

### Ask Questions
Ask questions to resolve ambiguities or uncertainties.  In my case, confirming inputs meet (or don't meet) certain criteria was good.  Also confirm outputs.  **Derive tests from the inputs/outputs.**

* What are the data types?
* How much data is there?
* Use of third party libs?
	* Say, for parallellism
* Who is the user?  (if relevant)

### Design an Algorithm
TODO:  Fill in

### Pseudo-Code
Use pseudo-code to help outline thoughts clearly and to initially hand-wave over details.  Just make sure you tell the interviewer you're writing pseudo-code.

### Code
Don't rush through coding!  Be slow but methodical.
* Use data structures generously - create objects as applicable.  Show you care about good OOD.
* Don't crowd your coding

### Test
Test your code!
* Extreme cases:  0, negative, `null`, maximums, etc...
* User error:  what if user passes in `null` or negative values?
* General case:  test the normal use case

If the algorithm is complicated or highly numerical (bit shifting, arithmetic, etc...), consider testing while writing code rather than just at the end.

When you find mistakes, don't "randomly" change stuff to fix the error.  Think about WHY the bug is occurring.

# Data Structures
[This section](data-structures.md) contains a list of the MINIMAL amount of data structures you should know for the interview.

# Algorithm Approaches
There is no magic panacea for determining an algorithm.  In fact, most problems have more than one solution.  [Here are some approaches](algorithm-approaches.md) that may work.  Note that they can also be mix-and-matched.

# Algorithms
[This section](algorithms.md) contains a list of the MINIMAL amount of algorithms you should know for the interview.

# Concepts
[This section](concepts.md) contains a list of the MINIMAL amount of concepts you should know for the interview.
