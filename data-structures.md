## Linked Lists
A linear collection of data elements in which linear order is not given by physical placement in memory.  Rather, each element points to the next via means of a reference.

It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.

12&bull;&rarr;99&bull;&rarr;37&bull;&rarr;&timesb;

For a doubly-linked list, an additional reference is added to each element that points to the previous element.
