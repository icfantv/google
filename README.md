# About This Repo
This repository is meant to be my study guide for a Java interview @ Google.  Much, if not all, of the non-code portion is generically applicable and was gleaned from multiple sources.  I claim no copyright whatsoever to the material - I just organized it in a format that made sense to me for studying.  If you find it useful, great.  If not, it's free.  Don't complain.

Sources used (probably not inclusive, my bad):

* Wikipedia
* _Cracking the Coding Interview_, 4th Ed. by Gayle McDowell
* ...others to come as I use them
